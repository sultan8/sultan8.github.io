Welcome! I'm Maryann, and I'm working to earn a PhD in the field of speech and cognitive science at Stockholm University. My project is aimed at figuring out how might human listeners adapt to the different ways people speak. That sounds trivial, when you consider that we interact effortlessly with different accents every day. But when you dig into individual talkers' acoustic patterns, it's not an easy task at all -- which is perhaps why it has taken machines really long to get skillful at it. At the [lab](http://www.hlp.rochester.edu/research/statement/) I work with, we have been trying to describe this adaptive ability through a framework based on rational learning and Bayesian belief updating. Needless to say, it has been challenging but I've learned a lot in the process.

Browse the pages to read a more about me and my [research interests](https://sultan8.github.io/publications/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
